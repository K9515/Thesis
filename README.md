# Thesis
# In this repository I have all relevent code and datasets for my thesis. To access the 1995-2010 datasets one can google "Harvard Dataverse Hall Windett" and the data should come up. In this repository I have my two final datasets of cases and judge ideology scores. I also have the python code that was used to create them.
