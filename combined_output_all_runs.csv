Stirling filed a petition in the Tax Tribunal challenging Leelanau County's decision denying his application for a principal-residence exemption (PRE) for tax years 2016-2019. The county denied the application because petitioner's wife had claimed a property-tax exemption for a residence in Utah for the same tax years. Petitioner moved for summary disposition in the Tax Tribunal. The tribunal granted petitioner's motion, concluding that the Utah exemption was not substantially similar to the Michigan PRE because the Michigan PRE requires a person to be both an owner and occupier of the residence, while the Utah law allows owners who have tenants using the property as a primary residence to claim the exemption. The tribunal denied the county's motion for reconsideration, and the county appealed. The Court of Appeals, MURRAY, C.J., and M. J. KELLY and RICK, JJ., reversed, holding that the Utah exemption was substantially similar to the Michigan PRE. 336 Mich App 575, 970 N.W.2d 910 (2021). The Michigan Supreme Court, in lieu of granting leave to appeal, ordered oral argument on the application. 509 Mich 857, 969 N.W.2d 70 (2022).",149.0,1.0,,,1.0,154.0,Welch,Tax Law,,,,,,1.0,Bernstein,We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and reinstate the Tax Tribunal's order granting summary disposition to petitioner.,1.0,,,,,,,Cnty. of Leelanau,,,,153.0,,3.0,,,,,,,5-1,1.0,,150.0,,COUNTY OF LEELANAU,,0.0,,,,,,,,
